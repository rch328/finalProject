Milestones for Rachel


Hours:

Lab:
25 March 2019 - 2 hours - Writing rubric, coding base for temperature sensor (can't do more than the base without the sensor, which is in Chandler's house)

Not Lab:
13 March 2019 - 1 hour - Wiring, got motor to spin in one direction
25 March 2019 - 1 hour - Figuring out how temperature sensor works (before lab)
25 March 2019 - 1 hour - Changing plans
27 March 2019 - 2 hours - CAD up elevator presser, preliminary elevator code, more work on temperature sensor

Rubric:

Temperature Mechanism: 19 points
	Find temperature value from sensor: 7 pts 
	Analyze retrieved value: 3 pts
	Turn on fan based on analyzation: 9 pts

Elevator Mechanism: 15 points
	Code motor to raise arm: 9 pts
	Code servo to push button: 6 pts

Hardware Aspect of Robot: 6 points
	Build drive train: 2 pts
	Build arm: 3 pts
	Attach fan: 1 pt


Report of Challenge

	This challenge was fine. I overshot on the tracker, and thus am not as far along on the other things as I'd like to be. 
	The temperature and elevator will probably be the only things I code for this project, since I'm the one building and designing
	the physical robot. Brent said that was okay. Thus, I'm not quite done with the code, but it's coming along. I'm not sure what
	"[a] short report on how this challenge went" entails... I think the project's going well. Robots are fun to build, so it doesn't
	really seem like work.
